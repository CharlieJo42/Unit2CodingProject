"Water Logged" is intended to be a functional app for companies to incentivize their employees to take care of their health whilst simultaneously providing additional resources to charity.

Premise: For every ounce of water an employee drinks (and then logs under their specific user account), the company will donate one penny towards funding a clean-drinking-water charity. To prevent cheating or health issues, the amount of daily loggable water intake caps out at 72 ounces per user, per day. 

Main page: calming pastel blue sign-up page (with an option underneath to "log in" if already an active user)

Sign-up page is name, email, and company ID, but log-in for returning users will simply be their private log-in code (that is generated and sent via email upon sign-up). 

Once logged in, "Welcome (user's name)!" appears.

Main page is simply an empty glass with a form inside. 
User types in how many ounces of water they drank that day and hits "submit."
Upon receiving information, water animation fills the cup up to the equivalent ounce marker. 

(Note: It would be easier to simply give the options of ounces in increments of 8, but I felt that it would be more realistic to allow people to calculate rather than rounding to the nearest increment, as not all water bottles come in those designations)

To prevent spamming, a user can only enter one response per 24 hours, and cannot carry over amounts to the next day in excess of 72 ounces total. 

In the great magic of coding, all the answers for each company's set of employees will be stored and the weekly total billed out to notify how much will be donated to charity. (Weekly provides a more accurate readout and lowers the risk of companies bailing on payouts if the monthly amount is higher than estimated).

Graphs can be included to help users track their progress over time, and possible additions can be things such as mood trackers to help each user correlate their daily productivity in relation to how hydrated they are. Other bonus possibilities can be scoreboards to help rank employees within the company in order to foster competition.
